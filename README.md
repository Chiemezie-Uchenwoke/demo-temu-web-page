This is a demo Temu(dot)com web page created for the purpose of learning and growth.

NOTE: 

(1) When creating a drop-down that is a full width, you set the parent container of the nav to be relative and then the drop-down to have a position of absolute. That way, you      can have any kind of drop-down menu you want. 

(2) Using position relative and absolute, one can do basically anything from adjust space between content to position elements.

(3) The scroll bar color property has two values: EX red and orange. The red is the movable scroll bar and the orange is the X-scroll.
